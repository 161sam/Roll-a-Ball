## üöÄ Usage Instructions

### Method 1: Inspector-Based (Recommended for Artists/Designers)
1. **Open any scene**
2. **Add QuickSceneConsolidator component** to any GameObject
3. **Check desired operation in Inspector:**
   - `consolidateCurrentScene` - Repairs current scene only
   - `consolidateAllScenes` - Repairs all 6 scenes systematically
   - `generateReport` - Creates status report
4. **Results appear in Console with detailed logging**

### Method 2: Unity Menu (Quick Access)
1. **Go to Roll-a-Ball menu** in Unity menu bar
2. **Select Scene Consolidation submenu**
3. **Choose operation:**
   - "Consolidate Current Scene"
   - "Consolidate All Scenes" 
   - "Generate Status Report"

### Method 3: Direct Component Usage (Advanced)
1. **Add SceneConsolidationEngine component** to GameObject
2. **Configure settings in Inspector**
3. **Enable `autoConsolidateOnStart`** for automatic repair on scene load
4. **Monitor repair progress in Console**
