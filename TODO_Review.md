# TODO Review
The following tasks from `TODO_Index.md` remain open due to missing files or larger refactors:
- **TODO-OPT#8**: DetermineNextScene() uses hardcoded scene names. Implementing a configurable progression table would require additional data structures and is beyond current scope.
- **TODO-OPT#18 - TODO-OPT#33**: Corresponding files or broader architecture changes are absent or complex. These items remain open for future work.
